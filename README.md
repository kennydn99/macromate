# MacroMaker

MacroMaker is a calorie and macro calculator with a meal plan generator. This tool helps users track their nutrition goals efficiently while offering dynamic meal planning options.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌟 Core Features (MVP – Minimum Viable Product)

- **User Input Form**: Collects age, gender, height, weight, activity level, and goal (bulk, cut, maintain).
- **Calorie & Macro Breakdown**:
  - Uses the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to calculate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).
  - Adjusts calorie intake based on the goal:
    - Bulk (+10-20% calories)
    - Cut (-10-25% calories)
    - Maintain (TDEE calories)
  - Provides macronutrient breakdown (Protein, Carbs, Fats) based on common ratios.
- **Meal Plan Generator**: Creates a simple meal plan matching the user’s macro targets.

### 💡 Extra Features (Stretch Goals)

- **🔥 Dynamic Food Database**: Integrate with a Nutrition API (Edamam, USDA, or Spoonacular) to fetch real food items & macro data.
- **🔥 User Authentication**: Save user preferences & meal plans.
- **🔥 Meal Plan Customization**: Allow users to swap out meals while keeping macros balanced.
- **🔥 Progress Tracking**: Enable users to log their weight changes over time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend:

- React.js – For a dynamic UI
- Tailwind CSS – For modern and responsive styling

### Backend (Optional, if storing user data):

- Node.js + Express – Backend for user data & saved meal plans
- Firebase – For quick authentication & database storage

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

✔ **Full-stack potential** – Showcases both frontend and backend skills.
✔ **Real-world application** – Useful for anyone tracking nutrition and fitness goals.
✔ **Skill diversity** – Covers UI design, API integration, and potential authentication.
✔ **Fast to build** – Basic version can be completed in a week with room for expansion.

## 📝 Next Steps

1️⃣ Build the basic version (calorie calculator & static meal plan).
2️⃣ Enhance UI/UX for a professional look.
3️⃣ (Optional) Add API integration for real food data.
4️⃣ Deploy the project on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
